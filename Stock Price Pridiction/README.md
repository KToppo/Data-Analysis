**Title:** Portfolio Risk and Return Analysis Script

**Description:**

This Python script provides functionalities for portfolio risk and return analysis, enabling you to:

  - **Download historical closing prices:** Retrieve closing prices for a specified timeframe using the `nselib` library (installation instructions provided).
  - **Perform data cleaning:** Filter and prepare the downloaded data for analysis.
  - **Calculate portfolio risk:** Estimate the expected risk of your portfolio using the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) framework.
  - **Calculate expected return:** Determine the anticipated return of your portfolio based on historical data.

**Dependencies:**

  - `nselib`: Install with `pip install nselib` ([https://pypi.org/project/nselib/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://pypi.org/project/nselib/)).
  - `pandas`: Usually pre-installed in most scientific Python environments. Consider `pip install pandas` if needed.
  - `tqdm`: Install with `pip install tqdm` for progress bar visualization.
  - `numpy`: Usually pre-installed in most scientific Python environments. Consider `pip install numpy` if needed.

**Usage:**

1.  **Clone or download the repository.**
2.  **Now Simply start using is with:**
   - `main.py`

**Example:**

1.  Modify the `symbols` dictionary in the script with your desired share names and corresponding investment amounts.
2.  Run the script: `main.py`

**Output:**

The script will print the estimated risk and return of your portfolio for the upcoming year (based on the provided timeframe).

**Advanced Usage:**

  - You can modify the timeframe for historical data retrieval by adjusting the `from_date` and `to_date` arguments in the `data_modeling` function.
  - The script currently uses a simple covariance-based approach for risk estimation. Explore more advanced techniques like using correlation coefficients or factor models for enhanced risk assessment.

**Disclaimer:**

  - Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
  - This script is provided for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice. Always conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.

**Additional Notes:**

  - Consider using a virtual environment to manage dependencies specific to this project.
  - This script assumes certain levels of familiarity with Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, and potential API usage with `nselib`.

I hope this enhanced README.md provides valuable information for users and contributes to the success of your project\!
